# behavior_state_mPFC_scripts
Scripts tied to Behavior state representation in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (Rautio, Nevjen, Hem, Dunn, Whitlock, 2024).

The scripts included here are used to perform some processing of the spike data, perform the population vector decoding of behavior states, calculate coactivity measures (pair care), and construct UMAP projections of neural activity from various ensembles of cells.
